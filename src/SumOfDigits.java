		//Input data are in the following format:
		//
		// first line contains N - the number of values to process;
		// and then N lines will follow describing the values for which sum of
		// digits should be calculated by 3 integers A B C;
		// for each case you need to multiply A by B and add C (i.e. A * B + C)
		// - then calculate sum of digits of the result.
		// Answer should have N results, also separated by spaces.
